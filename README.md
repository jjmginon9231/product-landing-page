# Product Landing Page

## Overview
This Product Landing Page is a sample web page designed to showcase products with a sleek, responsive layout. Inspired by The Webfix's [Complete Responsive Product Landing Page Website Using Bootstrap-5 Only](https://youtu.be/Nlv91MhRD2k?si=JmBX6fGTQ53l3dvn), this page incorporates modern web development techniques and adheres to the [best practices](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode) as taught by [Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode). This web page was also created as part of my [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#build-a-product-landing-page-project)

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the page looks good on various screen sizes using media queries.
- **Semantic HTML**: Follows semantic HTML tags for improved SEO and accessibility, as explained in Dave Gray's [Semantic HTML Tags Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3TfdUqpuU).
- **Organized CSS**: Employs BEM methodology for CSS class naming to keep stylesheets maintainable and scalable, as outlined in Dave Gray's [BEM Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNPdifWAAa4).
- **CSS Custom Variables**: Implements CSS custom properties for theming and easier style management, including a dark mode option, as demonstrated in Dave Gray's [CSS Custom Variables & Dark Mode Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_M7D0PfOFM).
